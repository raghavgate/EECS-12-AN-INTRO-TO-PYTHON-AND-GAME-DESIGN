# EECS-12-AN-INTRO-TO-PYTHON-AND-GAME-DESIGN
Welcome to the EECS 12 repository! This repository contains projects and assignments completed during the EECS 12 course, an introductory course to Python programming and game design.

This repository showcases the work completed as part of the EECS 12 course, which covers fundamental concepts in Python programming and introduces game design principles. The projects are designed to reinforce programming skills, problem-solving techniques, and creativity in game development.

HW3: Reading and writing from file.

This project introduced the concept of reading an input file in text format, editing the contents and saving the file.

HW4: Animation in Python.

This Project introduced the concept of animation in Python. Using a custom graphics file and the time library, the animation involves designing your own car/truck and controlling the speed at which it travels across the screen. There are also other functions such as changing the scenery in the background.

HW5: Simple Python Game.

This project involves applying all the concepts learnt in the course and the Homeworks. A game in which various different cars are spawned and start moving across the screen at different speeds. The objective is to click on the cars before they reach the end of the screen. The game keeps track of the various cars clicked and their colors as well as displaying the color of the car that was clicked most recently.
